// So far we've just been using function components.
// Now that we need to worry about state in our component, we need to use the ES6 class syntax.
// To turn an ES6 class into a React component, you extend React.Component (or `import {Component} from 'react'` and use that)
//
// Let's take this simple component for example:
//
// function SayHello(props) {
//   return (
//     <div>Hello {props.firstName} {props.lastName}!</div>
//   )
// }
//
// Here's how we'd express this using classes:
//
// class SayHello extends React.Component {
//   render() {
//     return (
//       <div>Hello {this.props.firstName} {this.props.lastName}!</div>
//     )
//   }
// }
//
// From here you can now start using this.state in your render method and call this.setState in callback handlers (like onClick).

class StopWatch extends React.Component {
  // in here, you should initialize the state with the following properties:
  // - running: false
  // - lapse: 0
  //
  // You'll also need two private properties
  // - _timer = null (keeps track of the setInterval id so you can clear it)
  // - _now = 0 (keeps track of the difference between the actual current time and when start was started)
  //
  // In your render method, you'll render a div wrapper with a label that renders {this.state.lapse} and two buttons (Start/Stop, and Clear)
  // You'll need to have an onClick handler on the <buttons> and you can define those using Public Class Fields
  // And you'll also need to have start and stop methods which your click handlers will use to start and stop the setInterval
  render() {
    return (
      <div>Stop Watch!</div>
    )
  }
}

// We don't need to do anything fancy here even with props, because the <StopWatch /> component tracks its own state!
export const example = () => (
  <StopWatch />
)

export default StopWatch
